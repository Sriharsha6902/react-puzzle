### Project Overview

React-Puzzle is a web app that features an intriguing puzzle called "The Mysterious Mansion." The goal of this project is to engage users in an interactive and challenging experience that tests their problem-solving skills, critical thinking abilities, and observational skills.
Puzzle Structure

The puzzle consists of multiple locations within the mansion, each presenting unique challenges and clues. There are a total of three locations: the Hall, the Library, and the Computer Room. The user must navigate through these locations to reach the hidden exit of the mansion.
### 1. Hall

The first location is the Hall, where users will encounter a large picture on the wall that contains a hidden message. To progress further, the user needs to decipher the message using three available clues. Choosing the correct answer leads the user to the next location, while a wrong turn results in reaching a dead-end.

The Library is the second location, housing an ancient note with a riddle. Solving the riddle will reveal two potential paths, but only one of them leads to the solution. Choosing the wrong path will lead the user to a dead-end.

  To solve this, look at the note. You can observe that there is something written on it. It says "I have keys that open no locks, I have space but no room, you can enter but cannot go outside. What am I?" It means "keyboard".

### 3. Computer Room

The third location is the Computer Room, which contains an old computer. To uncover the map of the hidden exit, the user must enter the correct password into the computer. The password can be derived from two available clues. If the user enters the correct password, they successfully solve the puzzle and exit the mansion.
